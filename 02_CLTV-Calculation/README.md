**Customer lifetime value.** 

It is the monetary value that a customer will bring to this company during their relationship with a company. 

At RFM, we divided our customers into groups, but we did not have the knowledge to measure how these customers would add value to us from a broader perspective, ie time projection.

**CLTV** = (Customer Value / Churn Rate) x Profit Margin

**Customer Value** = Average Order Value * Purchase Frequency

**Average Order Value** = Total Revenue / Total Number of Orders

**Purchase Frequency** = Total Number of Orders / Total Number of Customers

**Churn Rate** = 1 - Repeat Rate



**Repeat Rate:** The ratio of returning customers. If 10 customers went and 2 came back, the repeat rate is 0.2.

Customer life time values have been calculated, but there is **not temporality** here. 

That's why I made a customer life time value prediction using BG-NBD and GammaGamme models.
